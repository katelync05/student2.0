## Project Overview

As Ellie is an elite water polo player and Ishraq and I don't know much about the sport ourselves, we decided to make our project centered around teaching others about the sport. Our project allows users to ask questions about water polo to AI and stay updated on local games as well as our very own school team. There is also a short quiz to test user's knowledge of the sport after exploring our site. 

## My feature 
My role in our group was Frontend and Scrum Master. For our project, I did the styling, formatting, and performed fetch code for the homepage, AI feature, as well as the login/signup pages. A small feature that I added was also the water polo quiz.

## Homepage 
Originally, this was our plan but for the site but after I followed it, I decided it would look better to have the cards side by side. This is my homepage design:

## AI
For cohesiveness I used the same colors and gif.
