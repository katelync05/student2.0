## Project Overview

As Ellie is an elite water polo player and Ishraq and I don't know much about the sport ourselves, we decided to make our project centered around teaching others about the sport. Our project allows users to ask questions about water polo to AI and stay updated on local games as well as our very own school team. There is also a short quiz to test user's knowledge of the sport after exploring our site. 

## My feature 
My role in our group was Frontend and Scrum Master. For our project, I did the styling and formatting for the homepage, AI feature, as well as the login/signup pages. I did some work with backend

## Requirements 
- Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online datas stream, a file.
    - The project utilizes input by including a login/signup page for users to add their names to the database as well as input their player stats

- Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose
    - In SQLite database users are stored and are added when they sign up
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blank.png "list")

- At least one procedure that contributed to the programâ€™s intended purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters:

- Calls to your student-developed procedure:
    - uses JSON to connect data and retrieves the bot's message from the backend
