For teamwork, Ellie, Ishraq, and I created a group chat and got to know each other's interests and became friends over the course of the trimester.

## Blog

I kept my blog updated with all my reviews, notes from team teaches, test corrections, etc. 
Each week I put my plan in the left column and added hacks accordingly to the right side. Then, at the end of the week I would put my code and other things I did and summarized it on the left underneath my plan (aka my review ticket).

## Project Work/Outline
- See the final Tri 2 individual review blog. I was Scrum Master and Frontend developer and I finished my part of the code in a timely manner. I was able to make more finishing touches and changes because I was always on schedule. 
- This is our draft for the guide

- We decided that it would be better for the cards to be lined up horizontally rather than vertically so we ended up changing the structure a bit.

## Issue/Utterances 
- My issues from this tri: https://github.com/katelync05/student2.0/issues
- I peer reviewed Eunseo Lim's final CPT project, my comment is underneath her issue. 

## CPT Requirements
- our project meets all the collegeboard requirements
    - Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online datas stream, a file
    - Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the users purpose
    - At least one procedure that contributed to the programâ€™s intended purpose where you have defined: the name, return type, one or more parameters:
    - An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure
    - Calls to your student-developed prodcedure:
    - Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or ) based on input and program functionality

The water polo guide we created has a login and signup page for users to input game scores. There is an AI where users can learn more about waterpolo by asking the bot questions. Our third feature is a way for users to input player stats to a list and the final feature is a mini quiz that tests their water polo knowledge.
