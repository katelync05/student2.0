- Learned about types of computing bias and crowdsourcing 
    - Notes from TeachTeach: 
    - pros:
        - even if faulty, it is good to have as much information as possible
        - cost-effective way of getting information
        - good for startup businesses who donâ€™t have the funds to do a bunch of marketing and research
        - efficient, very good for people who need things more quickly
    - cons: 
        - quality control: there might be inconsistency in output
        - if hacked, the info of lots of users might be leaked
        - information might be biased
        - example: workout app that asks people to record some things about themselves, not so fit people are likely to not
