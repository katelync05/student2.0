## Reflection on Glows/Grows
- Nothing, since we didn't qualify. 

## Feedback
- Even though we didn't quality for NATM I am using the feedback that Mr. Lopez gave us. The frontend of our page still uses Nighthawk Pages as the home button and something I can do as frontend is find a way to remove that. Another thing we could have worked on is getting our third feature finished and running.

## Something I saw in CompSci 
- I really liked Eun, Nikki, Arthur, and Patrick's project. It was very cool to see them implement college choices and as a senior it is very applicable. Another project I liked was about mental health and there were lots of features like a mood tracker and personal journal. 

## Ceramics
- I went to see the Ceramics projects and the little gnomes were super cute.
